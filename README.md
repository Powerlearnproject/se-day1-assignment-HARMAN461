Software engineering.
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Understanding The Fundamentals.
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software devlopment is a step by step applies wngineering principles and tools to devlope and mantain high qulity software systems.
Software engineering plays a crucial roals in the technology industry byenabling the creation of software application and systems that power various aspect of mordan life, including communication entertainment and healthycare.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestones; it include the devlopment of programming language. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
(1)Design; creating high ieavel and detailed design of the software architure and use interface.the software to  (2) Deployment; releasing the software to uses ouer or customers. (3) Requirement; gathering and documenting user needs and system requirement 
(4)Testing; conducting various tests to ensure that softwatr meets quality standards and funtional requirement. (5) Maintenance; providing on going support and enhancement to the software devvelopment. (6) Iplimantatio writing and building the software according to the design specfication. 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall; sequential approach with distinct phases.Eg, requirements, dising, implementation.
Agile; iterative and incremental approch focused on flexibility collaboration to change
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
(1) Software devloper; responsible fore writing code and implementing software solutions (2) Quality assurance enginner; ensure software auality and designing test plans
(3)Projest manager; oversees the planning and delivery of software projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Devlopment; software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing debugging and testing code. Eg, visualstudio, eclipse.
Version control systems; software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating  work among team members. Eg, git, subvision
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
(1)Unit testing; Testing individual component or modules of software. (2) Acceptance testing; Testing the software aginest user requirement to ensure it meets user needs  (3) Integration Testing; its test the interaction betweendifferent components or subsystems.(4) System Testing;  testing the entire software system as a whole.
ITis a critial aspect of QA and involves various type of testing.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Understanding AI and proonote engineering
AI applications in software
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about  creating crafting questions or statement to get the best responses from AI models.
Making your questions clear and specific.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
